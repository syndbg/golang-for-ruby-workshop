Lets be creative here and pick something from the UIApp (https://github.com/tradeo/uiapp)
by the choice of audience and go to the process of attempting to re-do it in Golang.
(Please no front-end)

The goal here is to do something with absolutely minimum knowledge of Golang,
enough to write a few variables, functions and a HTTP server and try 
to figure out how to do something practical.


Basically this is mine and yours job's workflow (or at least it must be)
when learning anything new.


Googling in the process is essential.
We're going to cover the "main sources of truth" for Golang documentation/help.
